LavaVeil CSS Framework
LavaVeil is a modern, feature-rich CSS framework designed to simplify web development while providing flexibility, performance, and ease of customization. It aims to rival and surpass existing CSS frameworks by blending comprehensive utility classes, responsive features, accessibility improvements, and modern design components. This project delivers a robust foundation for developers to create stunning and user-friendly web applications.

Key Features
Utility Classes
LavaVeil introduces a wide array of utility classes to enable rapid prototyping and customization without writing additional CSS. These include:

Spacing utilities for padding and margin (u-p-0, u-m-1, etc.).
Flexbox utilities for layout management (u-d-flex, u-flex-column, etc.).
Text alignment utilities to control text placement (u-text-left, u-text-center, etc.).
Responsive Grid System
A highly customizable grid system supports fractional layouts and ensures consistent designs across various screen sizes. Use classes like u-grid-1-3 or u-grid-2-4 to create responsive, complex layouts effortlessly.

Dark Mode and Theming
LavaVeil incorporates CSS variables to enable seamless theming. Developers can switch between dark and light modes or customize colors to fit their brand.

Copy code
.theme-dark {
    background-color: var(--dark-bg);
    color: var(--light-bg);
}
Animation Utilities
Built-in animations like u-fade-in and u-bounce allow developers to add dynamic effects to their applications without relying on external libraries.

Focus-visible outlines for keyboard navigation.
ARIA role-based styling for elements like alerts.
Typography System
A scalable typography system ensures consistent text styles throughout the project. Classes like u-fs-1 (font size) and u-fw-bold (font weight) make it easy to apply styles.
